Face Recognition Attendance System

Overview =>
This is a Python-based Face Recognition Attendance System that utilizes computer vision techniques to recognize faces and log attendance.
The system uses the OpenCV library for image processing and the face_recognition library for face recognition.


Features =>
Face detection and recognition for attendance logging.
Automatic attendance tracking.
Easy integration with existing databases or systems.


Objectives of the Projects =>
To Reduce time wastage during conventional attendance. 
Automating the whole process.
To prevent fake attendance.
Encouraging the use of new technology. 


Requirements =>
Python 3.3+ or Python 2.7
macOS or Linux (Windows not officially supported, but might work)

Usage =>
When you install face_recognition, you get a simple command-line program
called face_recognition that you can use to recognize faces in a
photograph or folder full for photographs.
First, you need to provide a folder with one picture of each person you
already know. There should be one image file for each person with the
files named according to who is in the picture


The goal of the project was to build a facial recognition system for attendance.
The result of the project was a successful prototype of a facial recognition system
where the admin can create a account and add their information to the database.
Admin then can log in to the system and take attendance and face is detected by a camera and attendance is recorded in the database.
Admin could see the attendance report.
It can be used to take attendance and keep track of their attendance records. 


Acknowledgments =>
Special thanks to the OpenCV and face_recognition communities for their contributions.
Thanks to everyone who works on all the awesome Python data science libraries like numpy, scipy, 
scikit-image, pillow, etc, etc that makes this kind of stuff so easy and fun in Python.
